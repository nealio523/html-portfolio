<h3>The Goonies</h3>
<p>Oh, the nostalgia from the 80's. You can't beat it.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
<p>The Wizarding World starts to get dark, but things are not as they seem.</p>
<h3>Christmas Vacation</h3>
<p>The Griswolds have the hap-hap-happiest and funniest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny Kaye.</p>
